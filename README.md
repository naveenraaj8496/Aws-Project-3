This repository contains AWS Serverless Architecture for Secure Web Application with On-Premise SQL Connectivity

Key notes:
I have chose SQL server as my database, you can choose according to your requirements
I have choose python 3.9 as run environment in lambda and the dependencies have been installed in amazon linux OS and zipped those files.
You can install strong swan which is a software firewall in your local machine and choose that as your customer gateway static ip address
